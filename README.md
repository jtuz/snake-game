I started this project in order to improve my Golang skills, there is nothing new that experimented developers with Golang
can learn from this project, but... Any comment in order to improve the code or incoming ideas are welcomed

You can run the project typing `go run main.go` or build the entirely project by running `go build` and then 
run `./snake-game`.  So far there are a lot of improvements that can be performed on this project
